# fokus.
Simple way to create focused image. Check out the [App](https://kosamari.github.io/fokus).

Made by [@kosamari](https://twitter.com/kosamari). Inspired by [Alice Bartlett's blog post](http://alicebartlett.co.uk/blog/how-to-do-ok-at-slides).

## How does this work ?
This app uses HTML5 Canvas and WebWorker to adjust brightness & blur an image while leaving focus area untouched.
